# ByteCase Verify

**ByteCase Verify**

**ByteCase Verify** is a Windows-friendly forensic utility for creating file-level hash manifests, verifying files against prior manifests, and comparing saved manifest files.

It is designed for digital evidence, incident response, administrative evidence handling, and other workflows where a user needs a clear record of file names, paths, sizes, timestamps, and hash values.

ByteCase Verify is part of the **ByteCase** toolset by **Forensics Byte**.

Product domain: `byte-case.com`.

## Current Version

```text
v0.9.1 - ByteCase Branding / Theme Update
```

This project is currently in a **pre-1.0 release track**. A v1.0 stable release is being held until Microsoft code signing options are evaluated.

---

## Release Status

Current public Windows builds are **unsigned**.

Because the executable is not currently Microsoft code signed, Windows SmartScreen or antivirus products may display a warning when the application is downloaded or opened.

This does not automatically mean the application is malicious. It means the executable has not been signed with a trusted code-signing certificate and may not yet have reputation with Microsoft SmartScreen.

Users should only download releases from the official GitHub repository and should verify downloaded files using the published SHA-256 checksums.

UNSIGNED_WINDOWS_NOTICE.md

## What This Tool Does

ByteCase Verify helps users create structured, readable, and reusable hash documentation for selected files and folders.

The application can:

- Hash selected files.
- Hash files inside selected folders.
- Recursively collect files from folders when enabled.
- Calculate MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 hash values.
- Generate readable hash manifest reports.
- Save structured JSON manifests for later verification.
- Verify current files against a prior JSON manifest.
- Compare two saved JSON manifests.
- Export reports in TXT, CSV, DOCX, XLSX, and JSON formats.
- Store agency, unit, technician, output folder, branding, and report defaults.
- Include an optional report signature block.
- Use the shared ByteCase visual theme with Dark, Light, and System Default modes.

---

## What This Tool Does Not Do

ByteCase Verify is **not** a forensic imaging tool.

It does not:

- Acquire physical drives.
- Acquire logical volumes.
- Create E01 images.
- Create AFF4 images.
- Create RAW/DD images.
- Control write blockers.
- Detect write blocker status.
- Parse file systems at the block level.
- Interpret evidence.
- Parse forensic artifacts.
- Determine user intent.
- Determine file relevance.
- Make investigative conclusions.

This tool performs **file-level hashing and report generation only**.

## Primary Workflows

### 1. Generate a New Hash Manifest

Use this workflow when you want to create a new manifest for selected files or folders.

Basic workflow:

```text
1. Enter case and source information.
2. Select hash algorithms.
3. Add files and/or folders.
4. Hash selected items.
5. Review the manifest.
6. Export the manifest.
```

Normal manifest export creates:

```text
TXT
CSV
DOCX
XLSX
JSON
```

The JSON output can be loaded later for verification or comparison.

---

### 2. Verification Mode

Verification Mode is one of the main reasons this tool exists.

Use this workflow when you already have a prior JSON manifest and want to check whether current files still match that manifest.

Basic workflow:

```text
1. Load a prior manifest JSON.
2. Select the current files or folders.
3. Hash the current selection.
4. Review verification results.
5. Export the verification report.
```

Verification results may include:

| Result | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Matched | Compared hash values matched. |
| Hash mismatch | At least one compared hash value did not match. |
| Missing from current selection | A file listed in the original manifest was not found in the current selection. |
| New file not in original manifest | A current file was not listed in the original manifest. |
| Error | The file could not be compared or the comparison was ambiguous. |

Verification export creates:

```text
TXT
CSV
DOCX
XLSX
JSON
```

---

### 3. Manifest Compare Mode

Compare Mode is for comparing two saved JSON manifests without re-hashing current files.

Use this workflow when you have two manifests and want to see what changed between them.

Basic workflow:

```text
1. Open Compare Two Manifests.
2. Load Manifest A JSON.
3. Load Manifest B JSON.
4. Review compare results.
5. Export the compare report.
```

Compare results may include:

| Result | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Matched | Compared hash values matched. |
| Hash mismatch | At least one compared hash value did not match. |
| Only in Manifest A | A file exists in Manifest A but not Manifest B. |
| Only in Manifest B | A file exists in Manifest B but not Manifest A. |
| Error | The file could not be compared or the comparison was ambiguous. |

Compare export creates:

```text
TXT
CSV
DOCX
XLSX
JSON
```

---

## Supported Hash Algorithms

ByteCase Verify supports:

- MD5
- SHA-1
- SHA-256

Default settings:

```text
MD5: enabled
SHA-1: disabled
SHA-256: enabled
```

MD5 and SHA-1 are included for compatibility with existing workflows and legacy hash sets. SHA-256 is recommended for stronger integrity comparison.

---

## Hash Generation Method

Hash values are generated by the application using Python's built-in `hashlib` library.

Files are opened in binary read mode and processed in chunks. The selected hash algorithms are updated during the same file-read process.

The application does **not** use external command-line hashing utilities, PowerShell hashing commands, CertUtil commands, or third-party hashing executables to generate the listed hash values.

---

## Report Outputs

### TXT

The TXT report is a plain-text, readable report intended for easy review, copying, printing, and attachment to a case packet.

### CSV

The CSV output is useful for spreadsheet import, filtering, sorting, and system-to-system review.

### DOCX

The DOCX report is intended for readable report packets. It can include optional agency branding and optional signature lines.

### XLSX

The XLSX workbook provides formatted worksheets, summary sheets, filters, frozen panes, and issue/difference sheets for easier review.

### JSON

The JSON file is the structured manifest or report data. JSON is the preferred format for loading back into the tool for verification and comparison.

---

## Optional Signature Block

Normal hash manifest reports can include an optional signature block.

When enabled, TXT and DOCX reports include:

```text
Technician
Reviewed By
Date
Technician Signature
Reviewer Signature
```

This option can be enabled or disabled per report. It can also be set as a default in Settings.

The XLSX Summary sheet records whether the signature block option was enabled, but it does not include physical signature lines.

---

## Settings

The Settings window supports:

- Department / agency name
- Unit name
- Technician list
- Default technician
- Output folder configuration
- Saved manifest folder configuration
- Report branding image path
- Default hash algorithm selections
- Default report explanation settings
- Optional signature block default
- Dark, Light, and System Default theme

Settings are stored in a local `settings.json` file.

By default, output is written under `C:\Users\<user>\ByteCase\<case_number>\verify\`. A custom ByteCase Output Root may be selected in Settings. When a custom root is selected, ByteCase creates case folders directly inside that location.

When running from source, `settings.json` is created near the Python files.

When running from a packaged executable, `settings.json` is created beside the executable.

Do not commit a real agency `settings.json` file to a public repository unless it has been sanitized.

---

## Release Folder Layout

A packaged release folder should look similar to this:

```text
HashManifestGenerator-v0.9.0/
  HashManifestGenerator.exe
  README.md
  BUILD.md
  DEPENDENCIES.md
  KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md
  RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md
  RELEASE_NOTES.md
  UNSIGNED_WINDOWS_NOTICE.md
  settings.example.json
  HashManifestGenerator-v0.9.0-SHA256SUMS.txt
  ByteCase/<case_number>/verify/manifests/
  ByteCase/<case_number>/verify/verifications/
  ByteCase/<case_number>/verify/comparisons/
```

The top-level `release/` folder should also contain:

```text
HashManifestGenerator-v0.9.0.zip
HashManifestGenerator-v0.9.0-SHA256SUMS.txt
```

---

## Verifying SHA-256 Checksums

A release should include a checksum file named similar to:

```text
HashManifestGenerator-v0.9.0-SHA256SUMS.txt
```

To verify the ZIP on Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\HashManifestGenerator-v0.9.0.zip -Algorithm SHA256
```

Compare the displayed hash to the value listed in the checksum file.

To verify the executable after extracting the ZIP:

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\HashManifestGenerator.exe -Algorithm SHA256
```

---
